### Flutter Films App

A single-page application built with Flutter that showcases films in a visually appealing manner using cards. Users can search for films within the app. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and aims to demonstrate clean code practices.
## Background

The Flutter Films App is a project that I initially created some time ago. It was born out of my passion for films and my desire to create a visually engaging application for film enthusiasts. The app allowed users to browse through a collection of films presented in beautiful cards and provided a search functionality to easily find specific films.
## Code Refactoring

Recently, I decided to revisit the project with the intention of making it public and sharing it with the developer community on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn. To ensure that the codebase adhered to best practices and was easily understandable by other developers, I embarked on a refactoring journey.

During the refactoring process, I focused on improving the code structure and organization. I decided to adopt the MVC pattern to separate concerns and enhance the maintainability of the code. By implementing the MVC pattern, I aimed to provide a clear separation between the data model, the business logic, and the user interface components.

The refactoring process involved restructuring the code into different directories and modules to enhance modularity and reusability. I created separate folders for controllers, models, repositories, services, utilities, and views, each serving a specific purpose within the app's architecture. This approach allowed for better organization and easier navigation of the codebase.

Furthermore, I reviewed the existing code and made improvements to ensure consistency, readability, and adherence to coding conventions. I paid particular attention to removing any redundant or duplicated code and introduced reusable components where applicable. Additionally, I optimized the code for performance and improved error handling and exception management.

By refactoring the code, I aimed to create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that would be valuable to the developer community. I wanted to provide an example of how to structure a Flutter app following best practices, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
